# Ruby development container for Docker

A thick container for the development of Ruby applications. Includes common
dependencies (Postgres client, etc) as well as the Ruby documentation.

## Rationale

Using the offical Ruby images as a base is all well and good, but then for
every project I need to add on postgres (maybe), node (maybe), and other bits.

But using the container for development is somewhat awkward, as there is no
Ruby documentation installed.
